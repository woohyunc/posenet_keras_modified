# PoseNet-Keras-Modified
**Implementation of [PoseNet](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/relocalisation/)** using Keras/Tensorflow.

Improved to be able to train and predict between images with different aspect ratios accurately.

Predicts to within 3m/3° for images with the same aspect ratio and 10m/20° for images with different aspect ratios. Original Posenet architecture returns over 25m/30° of error for images with different aspect ratios. 

If the area you are using this model on is large, divide it into cells using get_data.py and train them individually.

As it was removed from the original paper's repository, posenet.npy can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1POHVS1i_kBaeg0OQeZ9De3sQYc47fSqJ
